# Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume
I am going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

John Hogue made the dataset available, and it can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal of my analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.


# Conclusion
In this project, I tried to find indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. I found two types of indicators:

Time indicators
1. The traffic is usually heavier during warm months (March–October) compared to cold months (November–February).
2. The traffic is usually heavier on business days compared to the weekends.
3. On business days, the rush hours are around 7 and 16.
Weather indicators
1. Shower snow
2. Light rain and snow
3. Proximity thunderstorm with drizzle
